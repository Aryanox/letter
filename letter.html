  <div class="tomy">Dear Sweetyy ,</div><br>
  To my moon of this darkest night sometimes, I look at people and I wish, if only they knew thier worth. Have you met yourself? Your tenderness is enough to make the flames go cold, and your heart is worth over a thousand carts of gold. You have a lot in common with the moon; its light and its beauty and how I meet her in the nights...sometimes the only way i can feel is to dream you..like I'm a guy who wants to lay on my death bed, holding your hand for the last time. Knowing I've loved you with all my might. I was in search of something, for someone who can fill this lonley void of this faded life of mine.  
<br><p></p>
And then I found someone, she was the inner reflection of me. She is more myself than I am. Sometimes I think whatever our souls are made of, her and mine are the same, it’s like I love to look in her eyes because whenever I look into them I see the other half of my soul. You don’t know but I always say this to my cousins that; I have given away my entire soul to someone who treats it as if it were a flower to put in her hair, and she made me feel the same. Well her eyes must be reading this now!
<br><p></p>
Naina and one day you'll meet a guy, and ultimately, he's going to find out, how you chew, how you sip, how you dance, how you smell at every point in the day. how your face looks underneath all your sadness. how you love, how you can be hyper at times, how certain games and shows make you really happy. how cranky you can get when you're tired. He's going to know everything about you. and you know what? he's still going to love you. Idk but they say love will find its way to you, when you least expect it, its true for me, idk about you. Once someone told me — Find someone that speaks your language so you don’t have to spend a lifetime translating yourself, fortunately for me i think i've found her.
<br><p></p>
It's been a couple of weeks and I'll never forget the day I met you! You become the main character of my story. I was a hopeless romantic and you,....you were in the right place at the right time, my dream came true, my easiest hello and my hardest goodbye, but what you should know is that I am so glad that you showed up and you did! You and I are the chapter that I didn't know that I needed and so many of the pages are folded at the corners because I know I will want to go back so I can always remember how good it was! 
<br><p></p>
And sometimes I think you have stolen everything from me. The beat in my heart, the breath in my lungs, the thought in my brain, yet I only wish for you to steal more…
<br><p></p> Naina I've never told you about what I think about love or what it means to me. Previously I thought something messy but now I somehow changed what I thought about it…so i heard myself saying, love is the mere inability to hurt the other but now i believe that it’s the constant conscious choice to not hurt the other. Love is probably letting go, soaking in, it's powerful enough to make you feel alive, it’s getting bored together, it’s living for the small moments, it’s therapeutic, it’s healing and can also be something that breaks you but again it's the same thing that will heal you. Love is feeling butterflies, it’s forgiving your other half, it’s about compromising and not comparison. It’s a bench where you sit with me enjoying the cold winds and the grass and not running for the finish line wondering who’s going to win.
<br><p></p> i love everything about you. <br>
and i'm not a guy who say that lightly 
i'm a guy who has faked love his entire life, i thought love was just something idiots thought they felt but this woman has a hold on my heart that i could not break even if i wanted to and there have been times I wanted to, it has been overwhelming and humbling and even painful at times but i could not stop loving you anymore than i could stop breathing.
i'm hopelessly irretrievably in love with you, more than you know.!!
<br><p></p>forever yours,
  <div class="tomy1" style="text-indent: 50px;">Love, Aryan</div>
